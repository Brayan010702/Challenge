    "\n",
    "To verify the reliability of the labels, I would start by looking directly at a sample of images from each class and checking whether the boxes and classes actually make sense, paying extra attention to the rare categories. This helps catch obvious issues like misaligned boxes, incorrect classes, or missing annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’d also rely on some basic statistical checks to spot anomalies things like bounding boxes that are way too large or too small, images that seem to have an unusually high number of objects, or class distributions that don’t match what we would expect. These patterns often reveal systematic labeling mistakes. \n",
    "Another useful step is to train a simple model and review the cases where the model is very confident but contradicts the label.\n",
    "Also, if the dataset was labeled by multiple people, I’d compare their annotations to see how consistent they were. High agreement suggests reliable labeling, low agreement means we should review those samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the current analysis, some red flags already stand out strong class imbalance, extremely rare categories that might lack consistent labeling, and images with a very high number of objects. All of these deserve a closer look."

    "### ✏️ Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Why did you choose these hyperparameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these hyperparameters based on the dataset size and the hardware I currently have available. With around 20,000 images, I needed a number of epochs that would allow the model to converge well without making the training process excessively long, so I went with 20, thinking about an overnight run. The resolution of 640 works well for industrial scenes where very large and very small objects coexist, and it’s also the YOLO standard that provides the best balance. The batch size of 8 helps avoid memory issues on Apple Silicon, and using mps allows me to take advantage of GPU acceleration, which noticeably speeds things up compared to CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. How do they affect training time, GPU/CPU usage, and accuracy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, training with MPS at 640px and a relatively small batch takes about 6–7 hours for 20 epochs. If I reduced the batch size even more, training would take longer, and lowering the resolution would speed things up but at the cost of worse performance on small objects. The GPU stays quite active during training (around 70–90%), memory usage is between 8 and 12 GB, and the CPU is mostly involved only in preprocessing. In terms of accuracy, higher resolutions could help capture finer details, but they significantly slow down training; and increasing the number of epochs might slightly improve mAP while also increasing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What would you try differently if you had more time or resources?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit more time, I would try larger models like YOLO11s or YOLO11m, adjust the loss function to compensate for class imbalance, and explore augmentations tailored to the lighting conditions in this dataset. With even more time, I would consider a two-stage training approach (pre-training and fine-tuning), combining models for more robust predictions, incorporating an active learning loop to identify hard cases, and running an automatic hyperparameter search to better optimize the configuration. I would also test TTA to improve inference performance.\n",
    "If I also had more resources especially more powerful hardware I would train at higher resolutions (such as 1024) to improve small-object detection, use larger batch sizes for more stable training, and experiment with bigger architectures like YOLO11l or YOLO11x. I could also run parallel experiments or explore more computationally expensive techniques such as complex ensembles or advanced hyperparameter search methods that would be too slow with my current setup."

    "### ✏️ Metrics Interpretation and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantitative Summary:**\n",
    "   - What are your `mAP50` and `mAP50-95` values?\n",
    "   - Which classes achieved the highest and lowest detection performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieved 27.5% mAP50 and 18.8% mAP50-95 after 20 epochs. Although these values are below what we typically expect in more controlled datasets, they make sense given the severe class imbalance and the limited training time due to hardware constraints.\n",
    "Looking at the per-class results, a clear pattern appears: classes with more data such as forklift (24,213 samples) and person (20,480 samples) performed noticeably better, reaching 72.6% and 47.4% mAP50. Classes with a moderate amount of data show mid-range performance, whereas the ones with very few annotations like gloves, traffic light, or van, all under 30 samples essentially failed to learn. The relationship is direct: fewer than 100 samples per class usually leads to little or no meaningful learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Qualitative Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Describe common failure cases (e.g., small objects missed, overlapping detections, background confusion).\n",
    "   - Were there any label quality issues or inconsistencies you observed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the metrics, several factors help explain these results. The most obvious is the extreme class imbalance: the gap between the most common class and the rarest one is enormous (over 2,000 to 1). This pushes the model to focus on what it sees all the time while ignoring classes that appear only occasionally.\n",
    "There are also challenges with small object detection, such as license plates, QR codes, and gloves. Many of these objects occupy less than 1% of the image, which is difficult for such a lightweight model trained at 640px resolution.\n",
    "On top of that, training for only 20 epochs was likely not enough for the model to fully converge, especially on underrepresented classes. And after inspecting the dataset, some label inconsistencies were observed, particularly in scenes with many objects or partial occlusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improvement Proposals:**\n",
    "   - Suggest at least two improvements (data augmentation, loss tuning, class balancing, etc.).\n",
    "   - How would you validate whether these changes actually help?\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve performance, the first step is addressing class imbalance. This can be done by increasing the frequency of rare classes during training and using Focal Loss, which helps the model focus on harder examples. The goal would be to raise rare-class performance to at least ~15% mAP50.\n",
    "It would also help to train at multiple scales and increase the input resolution to 1024px, which gives the model a better chance to capture small objects. Complementing this with stronger data augmentation for rare classes can reduce false negatives. Using TTA during inference can also improve robustness.\n",
    "Another key improvement is extending training to 80-100 epochs with a learning-rate scheduler like cosine annealing, while enabling early stopping to avoid overfitting. If hardware allows it, switching to a larger model variant (YOLO11s or YOLO11m) could make a big difference.\n",
    "Finally, there are some quick wins worth considering: generating synthetic samples for rare classes, adjusting confidence thresholds per class, or even adding a second detection stage specialized in small objects."
